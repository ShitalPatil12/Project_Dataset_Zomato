# Project_Dataset_Zomato
# Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the Zomato dataset to gain insights into the food delivery and restaurant industry. 
The analysis is performed using Python and several data science libraries.

## Project Overview

## The main objectives of this project are:
- To explore and clean the Zomato dataset.
- Perform data analysis to identify key trends and insights.
- Visualize the data using charts and graphs for better understanding.
  
The notebook performs tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:

- Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
- Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
- What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?
